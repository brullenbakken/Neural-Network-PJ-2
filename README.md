# Neural-Network-PJ-2
Published repository for the code part of the report of the second year mathematics project at the University of Amsterdam (UvA)

This code is based on the excellent book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) with the accompanying code [here](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) and its python 3 version [here](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython).



To run: use ``python3 test.py`` 


The [results of the eta experiment](images/bar_eta_avg20runs.png) and the [results of the mini batch size experiment](images/bar_mbs_avg20runs_eta15.png) have been added, since computation can take a couple of hours depending on system. The source code of these figures can be found in eta_experiment.py and mbs_experiment.py.
