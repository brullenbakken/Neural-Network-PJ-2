# Neural Network Project Wiskunde Jaar 2
Published repository for the code part of the report of the second year mathematics project at the University of Amsterdam (UvA)

The class in ``network.py`` is an extension on the class published [here](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) accompanying the excellent book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by [Michael Nielsen](https://michaelnielsen.org/) with the python 3 version of the book's code [here](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython) by [Micha≈Ç Dobrzanski](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski).



To test training the network: run ``python3 test.py`` or simply ``python test.py``


The [results of the eta experiment](images/bar_eta_avg20runs.png) and the [results of the mini batch size experiment](images/bar_mbs_avg20runs_eta15.png) have been added, since computation can take a couple of hours depending on system. The source code of these figures can be found in eta_experiment.py and mbs_experiment.py.
